Drop all rows that contain any NaN values, then create a dataframe that contains the columns that are needed for the question. 
Clean the updated dataframe to have the most relevant platforms ('PC','PS2','DS','PS3','Wii','X360','PS4','XOne')
Create scatter plots to present the sales of each platform in each region to show the density of the occuring sales in each platform and region. 
Come to a conclusion based on the scatterplots.
